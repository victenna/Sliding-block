Python in high school physics course. For teachers, kids and parents who enjoy Python programming. We present
an animation showing the sliding of a bar along an inclined plane in the presence of friction between the inclined
surface and the bar. The animation shows (qualitatively) the angle of inclination of the plane to the horizon, at
which the bar begins to slide along the plane. A simple code (less than 50 lines ) written with PYGAME graphic
library allows you to get acquainted with the basic commands of the library and basic logical commands of the Python 
language. This simulation is important and informative for schoolkids who study PROGRAMMING, physics and mathematics. 
Students in the process of creating a program learn a programming language and also master school physics and mathematics
better. Files for modeling this scenario can be downloaded free of charge at:
